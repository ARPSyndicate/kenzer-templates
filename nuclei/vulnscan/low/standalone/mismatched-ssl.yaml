  name: Mismatched SSL Certificate
  author: pdteam
  severity: low
  description: |
    Mismatched SSL vulnerability occurs when an SSL-enabled web server is configured to accept connections with both TLS and SSL protocols, allowing attackers to downgrade the security of a connection to a weaker, more vulnerable version of the protocol.
    This vulnerability can be exploited to gain access to sensitive data and potentially gain control of the system.
