id: CVE-2022-24856

info:
  name: Flyte Console < 0.52.0 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  author: pdteam
  severity: high
  description: |
    FlyteConsole is the web user interface for the Flyte platform. FlyteConsole prior to version 0.52.0 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) when FlyteConsole is open to the general internet. An attacker can exploit any user of a vulnerable instance to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs. Passing of headers to an unauthorized actor may occur. The patch for this issue deletes the entire `cors_proxy`, as this is not required for console anymore. A patch is available in FlyteConsole version 0.52.0. Disable FlyteConsole availability on the internet as a workaround.
